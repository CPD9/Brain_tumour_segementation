# Exploring the Frontiers of AI in Medical Imaging: Brain Tumor Segmentation

## Overview
In this project, my teammate Chijoke and I explore the application of Artificial Intelligence in medical diagnostics, focusing specifically on the segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans. Our aim is to leverage AI to enhance the precision of medical imaging, improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of brain tumors.

## Project Description
We developed an AI model using deep learning, specifically the U-Net architecture, to accurately identify and segment brain tumor tissues from normal brain tissues in MRI scans. The project not only aims to push the boundaries of AI in medical applications but also serves as an educational journey for us in the realm of neuro-oncology.

## Technical Approach
We utilized TensorFlow and PyTorch to implement our models, faced and overcame challenges related to data quality, and learned the importance of model interpretability. The use of U-Net architecture facilitated efficient and precise localization necessary for tumor segmentation.
